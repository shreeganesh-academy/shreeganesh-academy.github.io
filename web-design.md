# Navigation Bar Structure: Clean & User-Friendly
# 1. Logo Placement (Left-Aligned)
* Position: Place the logo at the top-left corner of the navigation bar.
* Functionality: The logo should be clickable, allowing users to return to the homepage from anywhere on the site. This ensures that the user always has an easy way to navigate back to the start of the site.
# 2. Main Navigation Links (Centeralized)
* Your main navigation should be centered to create a balanced, professional layout while maintaining accessibility to important content. The menu will consist of the following links:
* **Home:**
* The first link in the central navigation bar, allowing users to return to the homepage easily.
* **Courses:**
* Core Functionality: Since Courses is central to your website, this link should be prominent.
* Mega Dropdown Menu:
* English Medium: Organize the subcategories for the English Medium, listing class levels from 1st to 10th, and providing links to key subjects (Math, Science, English, etc.) for each class.
* Odia Medium: Similarly, list the Odia Medium classes from 1st to 10th, with links for each subject. The clear distinction between English and Odia will help users locate the content they need more easily.
* **Resources:**
* Mega Dropdown Menu:
* English Medium: Include study resources such as study materials, notes, guides, practice papers, and blog articles aimed at helping students.
* Odia Medium: Provide equivalent resources tailored specifically for Odia-speaking students, with materials available in Odia language.
* **About:**
* A link to the About Us page, providing background information about your educational platform and its mission.
* **Contact:**
* A link to the Contact Us page, allowing users to inquire about the platform, ask questions, or seek support.
# 3. Call to Action (CTA) Button (Right-Aligned)
* Position: Place the CTA button, labeled "Get Started", at the top-right corner of the navigation bar.
* Functionality: The Get Started button should serve as the central action point. When clicked, it should direct users to the Courses browsing page, where they can begin exploring available courses.

# Responsive Design
* Mobile: The navigation bar should be fully responsive. On smaller screens, convert the menu into a hamburger style. When clicked, it should reveal all the navigation options, including the mega dropdown menus for Courses and Resources.
* Sticky Navigation: The navigation bar should remain sticky at the top of the page as users scroll through content, ensuring they always have access to the menu.
